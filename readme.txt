This plugin allows you to build your own marketplace!

== Description ==

NS Marketplace Multi Vendor helps you to create your marketplace where people can sell his product increasing your earn and their
earnings.
To sell in your marketplace people must be registered. They can do it in the WooCommerce registration (specially adapted as you can see in the first screenshot) or in their account page if they are already registered as customer (they can see a new "Become Vendor" entry).
Once their are registered vendors can add and edit products. All Woocommerce products types are accepted. Vendors can do anything without getting into
your WP backend avoiding website problems!
Furthermore all used pages will be created on plugin activation. No work to do. You must only set your preferred settings in "Marketplace" page.
